Battle.LAN is a gaming "system" where users join a server with a roleplay character to battle together (not against each other). There are several enemies to fight against and the fun is that the players choose independent on each other if they want to fight against the upcoming enemy. So you have to bet that the others fight with you.

Example:
You fight against a dragon where 3 strong characters are needed to win.
You choose to fight because you want the loot.
But every other player (let's say 6) doesn't want to fight. So you will heavily lose.
But if the other six also fight with you, you will win and share the loot.

The complete system is text-based.
